## Description

Ras Dashen a WordPress theme which was first developed using underscore starter theme. The theme was then customized into one that can be used an enterprise level websites. It is responsive to different devices and compliant to most modern and older browsers. It can be used for enterprises, blogs, news portals, reviewers, and other related businesses.

## About Ras Dashen

Ras Dashen was originally developed to be used in a website design and development project for one of my local clients. After almost one year since its use, I decided to polish and improve it in order to make it available as open source for other people, which they can customize and use it for their next project. Furthermore, other developers can fork it and contribute to improve it.
